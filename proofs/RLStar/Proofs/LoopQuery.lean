# The loop program

`loopQ`'s run against the answers at one noise is `loopRounds` at that noise in every round, each
round with its family read dropped (`indecisiveLStarLoop_eq`), and each of those rounds reads its
family at that noise (`loopRounds_read`). Against any answers, each round's clustering reading at
most `a` prefixes and `b` suffixes, each family at most `f` members and each lazy round at most
`Nr` strings, a round asks at most `a (b + 1) + f Nr` strings (`card_reads_roundQ_le`), and the
loop `K` times that (`card_reads_loopRoundsQ_le`). The learner adds the last round's table, `f`
reads for each of its sifts' questions (`card_reads_learnerQ_le`).
