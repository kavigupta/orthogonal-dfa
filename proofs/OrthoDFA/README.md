# Machine-checked correctness of the E-L\* clustering algorithm

## What to read

- `OrthoDFA/Clustering.lean` — the oracle, the algorithm, and `ClusteringGuarantee`, the claim.
  It imports only Mathlib.
- `OrthoDFA/ClusteringQuality.lean` — `ClusteringQualityGuarantee`: averaged over a population,
  the returned family decides a prefix wrongly at most `εcov + slack` of the time on the uniform
  pool and at most `1/2 + slack` on any other, and leaves it undecided at most
  `2·indecisionLimit + slack` of the time on each.
- `OrthoDFA/FamilyRead.lean` — the suffix family's read of a string: accept at `X(w) ≥ kh`,
  reject at `X(w) ≤ kl`, undecided between, where `X(w)` counts the members `v` whose query
  `w·v` answers 1.  `FamilyReadIndependent`: for a suffix-free family the reads are independent
  across strings.  `FamilyReadByState`: strings in one DFA state read with one law.
  `FamilyReadTrichotomy`: wherever `BandHolds`, each read is accept at most
  `exp(−2(kh − kl)²/N)`, or reject at most that, or undecided at least a third.
  `FamilyReadGuarantee`: at `N = 62`, `kl = 20`, `kh = 42`, noise `1/5`, all three hold with
  `10⁻¹⁰` in place of the exponential.
- `OrthoDFA/Verify.lean` — names the proofs of the claims and prints their axioms, which should
  be only `propext`, `Classical.choice` and `Quot.sound`.

Everything under `OrthoDFA/Proofs/` is checked by Lean and need not be read to trust the claim.

## Scope

This proves the clustering step (`sample_suffix_family` and its gate) correct. It does not prove
that the E-L\* learner outputs the target DFA.
