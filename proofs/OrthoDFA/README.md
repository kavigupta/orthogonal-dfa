# Machine-checked correctness of the E-L\* clustering algorithm

## What to read

- `OrthoDFA/Clustering.lean` — the oracle, the algorithm, and `ClusteringGuarantee`, the claim.
  It imports only Mathlib.
- `OrthoDFA/ClusteringQuality.lean` — `ClusteringQualityGuarantee`: averaged over a population,
  the returned family decides a prefix wrongly at most `εcov + slack` of the time on the uniform
  pool and at most `1/2 + slack` on any other, and leaves it undecided at most
  `2·indecisionLimit + slack` of the time on each.
- `OrthoDFA/FamilyRead.lean` — the suffix family's read of a string: accept at `X(w) ≥ kh`,
  reject at `X(w) ≤ kl`, undecided between, where `X(w)` counts the members `v` whose query
  `w·v` answers 1.  `FamilyReadBound`: with the language a DFA's, the family suffix-free
  and the band passing `BandPasses`, the reads are independent across strings and every DFA
  state has one distribution its strings read with, which is accept at most `ε` of the time, or
  reject at most `ε`, or undecided at least a third with accept or reject at most `ε₂`; and is on
  its rarer decided side at most `ε`, or at most `κ` times as often as it is undecided.  `BandPasses` is the
  check the band selection rule `evidence_margin_for_population_size` makes, at
  `ε = cross_limit`, `ε₂ = MINORITY_READ_LIMIT` and `κ = MINORITY_UNDECIDED_RATIO`.
- `OrthoDFA/TripartiteSearch.lean` — `tripartiteSearch`, a bisection for where `agrees` turns from
  agreeing to disagreeing that steps past undecided positions, and `TripartiteSearchCorrect`: each
  result says what `agrees` is where it points, the queries stay between the endpoints and number
  at most `2 + 3⌈log₂(hi − lo)⌉`, and with nothing undecided it finds the turn exactly.
  `orthogonal_dfa/l_star/tripartite_search.py` is the same function.
- `OrthoDFA/ProbeDistribution.lean` — how probes are drawn (`PrefixDistribution`), where a replay
  of one is anchored (`uniformAnchor`), and the share of draws visiting given states (`coverage`).
- `OrthoDFA/RoundEnd.lean` — what it is for a round of the learner to end well, shared by every
  level: consistent, or a harvest mostly at bad states whose replay is spread and yields.
- `OrthoDFA/Hypothesis.lean` — the learner's hypothesis: a tree sifting strings to its leaves, and
  edges between the leaves.
- `OrthoDFA/Level2Probe.lean` and `OrthoDFA/Level2.lean` — level 2 of indecisive L\*,
  `indecisiveLStarLevel2`.
- `OrthoDFA/Level2Claim.lean` — `IdealRoundCorrect`: with every state's reads all undecided or
  all on its side, level 2 on `P` probes ends well but for chance at most `(P + 1)(1 − ε)^n`, `n`
  the clean probes in a row that end it.
- `OrthoDFA/Verify.lean` — names the proofs of the claims and prints their axioms, which should
  be only `propext`, `Classical.choice` and `Quot.sound`.

Everything under `OrthoDFA/Proofs/` is checked by Lean and need not be read to trust the claim.

## Scope

This proves the clustering step (`sample_suffix_family` and its gate) correct. It does not prove
that the E-L\* learner outputs the target DFA.
