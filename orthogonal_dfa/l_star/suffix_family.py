"""The suffix family a classification round reads against.

A noisy oracle cannot classify a string with one query, so the learner averages
membership over a *family* of distinguishing suffixes and only answers when the
mean lands decisively past a threshold. This owns that family: the suffix rows
and the memo of the means computed from them.
