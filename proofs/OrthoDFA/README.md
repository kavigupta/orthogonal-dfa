# Machine-checked correctness of the E-L\* clustering algorithm

## What to read

- `OrthoDFA/Clustering.lean` — the oracle, the algorithm, and `ClusteringGuarantee`, the claim.
  It imports only Mathlib.
- `OrthoDFA/ClusteringQuality.lean` — `ClusteringQualityGuarantee`: averaged over a population,
  the returned family decides a prefix wrongly at most `εcov + slack` of the time on the uniform
  pool and at most `1/2 + slack` on any other, and leaves it undecided at most
  `2·indecisionLimit + slack` of the time on each.
- `OrthoDFA/FamilyRead.lean` — the suffix family's read of a string: accept at `X(w) ≥ kh`,
  reject at `X(w) ≤ kl`, undecided between, where `X(w)` counts the members `v` whose query
  `w·v` answers 1.  `FamilyReadTrichotomy`: with the language a DFA's and the family
  suffix-free, the reads are independent across strings, each DFA state has one read law, and
  every state's law is accept at most `ε` of the time, or reject at most `ε`, or undecided at
  least a third, wherever the parameter check `TrichotomyAt` holds.  `FamilyReadShipped`: the
  same at `N = 62`, `kl = 20`, `kh = 42`, noise `1/5`, `ε = 10⁻¹⁰`.
- `OrthoDFA/Verify.lean` — names the proofs of the claims and prints their axioms, which should
  be only `propext`, `Classical.choice` and `Quot.sound`.

Everything under `OrthoDFA/Proofs/` is checked by Lean and need not be read to trust the claim.

## Scope

This proves the clustering step (`sample_suffix_family` and its gate) correct. It does not prove
that the E-L\* learner outputs the target DFA.
